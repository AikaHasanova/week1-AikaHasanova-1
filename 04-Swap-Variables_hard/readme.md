# Write a Python program to swap two variables.

Python: swapping two variables

Swapping two variables refers to mutually exchanging the values of the variables. Generally, this is done with the data in memory.


### Sample Output:
```
Before swap a = 30 and b = 20                    
After swaping a = 20 and b = 30
```

#Before swap a = 30 and b = 20
#After swaping a = 20 and b = 30
a = 30
b = 20

#a, b = b, a


a= a+b  # 50
b= a-b  # 30
a= a-b  # 50-30 = 20

print(a)
print(b)
